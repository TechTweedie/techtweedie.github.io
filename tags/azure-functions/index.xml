Session Overview At the Low Code No Code Microsoft Power Platform Conference 2024, I delivered a session titled:

Maybe we have used the Word connector, Dataverse, a bit of SharePoint, and a sprinkle of Outlook to deliver it.</description></item><item><title>At the M365 North User Group: Enabling Low-Code Developers to Create Custom Client Reports with a Helping Hand from Azure</title><link>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/240917-m365north/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/240917-m365north/</guid><description>📅 Date: 17th September 2024
