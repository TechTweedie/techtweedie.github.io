In this episode:
‚úÖ Topic 1 ‚Äì Show/Hide Tabs Dynamically in Model Driven Apps Ian walks through how to show or hide a whole tab in a model-driven app based on the value of a field, such as Status Reason. The demo covers:
Why you might want to hide/show tabs A full explanation of the JavaScript snippet used How to upload and register the script in your form libraries Gotchas to watch out for (like needing to register the event handler onload and onchange) Testing the functionality and reviewing console logs to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening under the hood üëâ This approach is especially useful when you only want tabs visible at specific record statuses instead of toggling individual fields.</description></item><item><title>D365 &amp; Power Platform UG North East ‚Äì March 2025 Meetup</title><link>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/250327-d365ppugne/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 06:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/250327-d365ppugne/</guid><description>D365 &amp;amp; Power Platform UG North East ‚Äì July 2025 Meetup

Luckily, Power Apps has made it possible to achieve this. With the help of Power FX, which is the same language used in canvas app development, anyone can efficiently customise their app‚Äôs command bar without needing prior knowledge of JavaScript or the Ribbon Workbench.</description></item><item><title>Clone with PowerFX Command button</title><link>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/clone-with-powerfx-command-button/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/clone-with-powerfx-command-button/</guid><description>Introduction Cloning multiple records within a data view in a Model-Driven App is a common request from end users. It helps them quickly fill out data fields in situations where only a few values differ between records.
In this blog post, we will explore how to add a custom button to the command bar in a Power Apps model-driven application to duplicate multiple records. Power Apps recently introduced this helpful feature, and the best part is that it can be achieved using Power FX, the same language used for developing canvas apps.</description></item><item><title>Create a Solution Configuration File</title><link>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/choose-what-dataverse-search-indexes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/choose-what-dataverse-search-indexes/</guid><description>Introduction Want to deploy your Power Apps Solution files quickly via Pipelines? Not sure how to set your environment variable or connection references. This blog post will explain how we solved this problem using a Solution Configuration File.
Understanding the Need for a Solution Settings File A solution settings file is crucial when your solution involves environment variables or connection references. Without it, you might end up with configurations that do not carry over the intended values, leading to solutions that don‚Äôt behave as expected in different environments.</description></item></channel></rss>
