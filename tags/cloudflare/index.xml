It was late one evening, and I was in a bit of a rush; as with many people online, I chose to use Cloudflare to protect the website.
However, problems arose after setting up the WordPress website when I configured the SSL/TLS side of things.
I switched on Cloudflareâ€™s proxy as normal.
So far so good.
Then I continued to edit the site before handing it over to my friend; however, I noticed I was getting load errors.</description></item></channel></rss>
