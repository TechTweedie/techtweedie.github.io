Welcome to the very first episode of **Power Platform Clinic** with Duncan and Ian.

{{< youtube xWqKIG3GvN8 >}}

In this episode:

### ✅ Topic 1 – Show/Hide Tabs Dynamically in Model Driven Apps

Ian walks through how to show or hide a whole tab in a model-driven app based on the value of a field, such as **Status Reason**. The demo covers:

- Why you might want to hide/show tabs  
- A full explanation of the JavaScript snippet used  
- How to upload and register the script in your form libraries  
- Gotchas to watch out for (like needing to register the event handler onload and onchange)  
- Testing the functionality and reviewing console logs to understand what's happening under the hood

👉 This approach is especially useful when you only want tabs visible at specific record statuses instead of toggling individual fields.

### ✅ Topic 2 – Calculated Columns vs Measures in Power BI

Duncan takes over to demystify when to use calculated columns vs measures in Power BI, including:

- How calculated columns are stored in the model and increase dataset size  
- How measures calculate dynamically based on report context  
- Use cases for each, including slicing, relationships, and dynamic calculations  
- Performance considerations for model refresh times and visuals  
- Best practice tips on organising measures in a dedicated Measures table

🔎 **Key takeaway:**  
Use calculated columns when you need a static value for slicing or relationships, and measures for dynamic aggregations like KPIs and totals.
