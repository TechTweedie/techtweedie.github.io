üìç **Location:** M365 North User Group  

## Session Overview

At the M365 North User Group, I delivered a session titled:

‚ú® **"Enabling low-code developers to create custom client reports with a helping hand from Azure"**

Many of us have found a way to deliver custom reports from Dataverse, or other outputs to our clients via low-code tools such as Power Automate. Maybe we have used the Word connector, Dataverse, a bit of SharePoint, and a sprinkle of Outlook to deliver it.

Maybe we have created a mail merge type flow, but what and when do you trigger it?

Ever wondered if you could get the client to trigger it via a web link?

Ever wondered if you could get the client to trigger it via a web link in the context of themselves?

Ever wondered if you could get the client to trigger it via a web link in the context of themselves, with Single Sign-On?

In this presentation, I showed how, with a bit of Azure, you can enable low-code developers to create custom client reports, or any other output you can think of, using Power Automate, whether it be for membership certificates, invoices, or anything else.
