## Session Overview

At the Low Code No Code Microsoft Power Platform Conference 2024, I delivered a session titled:

‚ú® **"Enabling low-code developers to create custom client reports with a helping hand from Azure"**

Many of us have found a way to deliver custom reports from Dataverse, or other outputs to our clients via low-code tools such as Power Automate. Maybe we have used the Word connector, Dataverse, a bit of SharePoint, and a sprinkle of Outlook to deliver it.

Maybe we have created a mail merge type flow, but what and when do you trigger it?

Ever wondered if you could get the client to trigger it via a web link?

Ever wondered if you could get the client to trigger it via a web link in the context of themselves?

Ever wondered if you could get the client to trigger it via a web link in the context of themselves, with Single Sign-On?

In this presentation, I showed how, with a bit of Azure, you can enable low-code developers to create custom client reports, or any other output you can think of, using Power Automate, whether it be for membership certificates, invoices, or anything else.

This presentation is a co-pilot free zone üôÇ
