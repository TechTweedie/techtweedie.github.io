{{< youtube N8XHipg1HPk >}}

In this episode:

### âœ… Validating Email Domains with Power Automate

Ian shares a powerful, free way to validate email domains using Power Automate, showing:

- Why validating the entire email address is tricky without sending a link
- How to split out the domain using the split function
- Using the **CheckDomain** connector to confirm whether a domain exists and can receive emails
- How this approach avoids the costs of third-party services and can be used with data from anywhere: Dataverse, Excel, or SharePoint

Ian walks through building the flow step by step, demonstrating how it splits the email, checks the domain, and writes the result back to a field in Dataverse to clean up data input.

### âœ… Collating Reports into a Power BI App

Duncan then dives into Power BI to show:

- How to create an app to group reports together for easy access
- Using the app to share reports with the whole organisation or specific groups
- Tips for embedding reports in Teams for easy mobile access by managers and leadership
- Key licensing considerations when deploying Power BI apps across your organisation

### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- **Email validation** using Power Automate and the CheckDomain connector can significantly improve your data quality without paid tools.
- **Power BI apps** make accessing reports easier for end users and simplify sharing across Teams and devices.
