Azure functions are a very handy way of getting something small done very quickly. Often these have to be secured and sometimes with an identity provider that is not stright out of the box.

Today I am going to take you through the steps I took to secure an azure function using Azure B2C.

## Step 1 â€“ Create app in Azure B2C

### PREREQUISITE

- Azure Function
- The Azure Function URL
- Azure B2C Tenant configured with user flows

### STEP 1

To start with register an application in Azure B2C.

In Redirect URI, (where I have put in https://jwt.ms) enter in the following: `https://{azure function url}/.auth/login/aadbc/callback`

Once you have registered it, open up the application and click on toÂ **Authentication**. Scroll down and tick bothÂ **Access tokens**Â andÂ **ID tokens**.

Next we will need to create a the Secrets, so click onÂ **Certificates & secrets**Â in the left hand menu, and then click onÂ **New client secret**.

Once you click onÂ **Add**, you will then be able to see the secret, copy it somewhere as we will need it later and you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

We also need to grab the client id of the application we have created.

Also, while you are in your Azure B2C tenant, grab the URL to theÂ **.well-known/openid-configuration**. There are a few ways you can get this; one is by going in to one of yourÂ **user flows**Â used forÂ **sign up sign in**. Click onÂ **Overview**, and thenÂ **Click on Run user flow**.

## Step 2 â€“ Add authentication to your Azure Function

Navigate to your Azure Function, this wonâ€™t be inside your Azure B2C tenant.

Go toÂ **Authentication**Â underÂ **Settings**Â in the left-hand menu.

Click onÂ **Add identity provider**, and chooseÂ **OpenID Connect**. You will then be presented with a page that looks like this.

Under OpenID provider name enter in: aadbc

Metadata URL enter: theÂ **.well-known/openid-configuration**Â URL

Then make sure that underÂ **Restricted access**Â you have chosenÂ **Require authentication**, and then underÂ **Unauthenticated requests**Â you have chosen an option appropriate for your needs.

## Step 3 â€“ Test it

Give it a test, try and access something you have placed behind it and it should work ðŸ™‚
