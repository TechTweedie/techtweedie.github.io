## Power Platform Clinic Episode 6 ‚Äì Certs, Consultancy, and Career Conversations

{{< youtube 0fnbmPvHN5E >}}

In this episode of the Power Platform Clinic, Duncan and I get stuck into some big-picture questions from the community‚Äîabout Microsoft certifications, life as a consultant, and how to grow your career across the Power Platform and beyond.

## üéì Are Microsoft Certifications Worth It?

Spoiler: Yes, but with caveats.

I share how I started collecting Microsoft certs back when they were being offered free (shoutout to the days of the 900 series!). But it‚Äôs not about collecting badges‚Äîcerts give you structure, breadth, and that theoretical grounding that helps when you‚Äôre diving into something new.

> "Certifications are useful, but experience trumps all. Ideally, you want both."

We talk through the differences between the PL-200 and PL-400, and why broader learning (outside of your usual lane) is such a smart investment‚Äîespecially when it helps you understand your colleagues‚Äô roles.

## üíº Day in the Life of a Consultant

Consultancy looks different depending on where you sit.

I share what it‚Äôs like working at a global consultancy like Capgemini, from running projects with deep Azure integration and Power Platform DevOps, to mentoring devs and liaising with senior stakeholders. We chat about coaching vs mentoring, wearing different hats, and being the go-to expert in your domain.

We also break down the three ways we all get paid:

1. üí∞ Salary  
2. üíö Satisfaction  
3. üìà Experience  

And why aiming for two out of three is the sweet spot.

## üß† More Than Power Platform: Think Strategically

This isn‚Äôt just about learning Flow expressions and Dataverse tables. It‚Äôs also about building skills that elevate your thinking‚Äîlike Agile, PRINCE2, TOGAF, and Six Sigma.

> "Every Agile project lives inside a bigger waterfall project somewhere."

We talk about architectural thinking, knowing how to speak the language of the business, and designing with failure (and damage limitation) in mind.
