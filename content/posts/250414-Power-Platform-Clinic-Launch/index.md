## Introducing: Power Platform Clinic

If you've ever hit a blocker in Power Platform and thought, *"I wish I could just ask someone who’s done this before…"*, this is for you.

I’m launching **Power Platform Clinic**, a community-led initiative to help makers, developers, and admins get unstuck, validate their designs, or just explore options with someone who’s been there before.

This is a joint project between myself and [Duncan Boyne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncanboyne/) — aka **The Power BI Kinda Guy** — and it’s designed to be informal, practical, and focused on real-world outcomes.

## What is Power Platform Clinic?

The **Clinic** is a series of short, focused sessions where we walk through real questions from the community. You submit your question in advance, and we’ll select a handful to explore live in a recorded or 1:1 format depending on the complexity and interest.

We’ll cover everything from:

- Flow architecture  
- Dataverse and security models  
- DevOps and pipelines  
- Canvas and model-driven UX challenges  
- Power BI integration scenarios  
- Custom connectors and governance strategies  

Each session will focus on *your* real-world problems — not vendor demos or theory.

## How It Works

- Submit your question or challenge in advance using the link below  
- We’ll hand-pick questions that provide the most value to the community  
- If selected, we’ll invite you to join a session and work through it together  

Whether you’re designing an architecture, stuck with licensing limits, or want a second opinion on an automation approach — bring it to the clinic.

## Submit Your Question

Visit **[powerplatformclinic.github.io](https://powerplatformclinic.github.io)** to submit your challenge, share context, and ask us anything.

We’ll follow up if your question is selected, and let you know how to get involved in the session.

## Watch Us on YouTube

All sessions will be available to watch (and rewatch) on our YouTube channel:  
**[youtube.com/@PowerPlatformClinic](https://youtube.com/@PowerPlatformClinic)**

We’ll also share tips, patterns, and walk-throughs based on the questions we receive.

## Why We're Doing This

Duncan and I have both spent years helping teams get the most from Power Platform, often in 1:1 chats, DMs, or hallway conversations at events. We wanted to create a more open format that brings that same value to more people.

This isn’t a commercial service. This is community — focused on practical help, shared learning, and faster problem-solving.
