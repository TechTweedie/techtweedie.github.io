## ðŸ¤– Calling a Dad Joke API from Power Automate

Ever needed data from an API only to find there's no Power Automate connector?

In my segment, I showed how to call the [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) REST API â€” a lightweight, no-auth service for generating random dad jokes.

### What I Covered:

- Testing the endpoint in **Postman** to check the response.
- Setting a simple `Accept: application/json` header.
- Using **HTTP actions** in Power Automate to call the API.

No authentication, no custom connectors, no nonsense â€” just a clean, quick integration to liven up your flow.

## ðŸ“Š Custom Visuals in Power BI with Duncan

Been tempted by flashy Power BI visuals but wondered if theyâ€™re actually safe?

Duncan walked through how to bring Power BI custom visuals into your reports *safely* and *effectively*.

### What Duncan Covered:

- Where to find custom visuals.
- Understanding publisher trust and Microsoft certification.
- Connecting visuals to your data model and formatting options.

Custom visuals can level up your dashboards â€” as long as you know where they came from.
