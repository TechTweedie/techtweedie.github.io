# üß™ Playwright + Power Platform + DevOps Pipelines? Yes please!

Just dropped a new video where I walk through the latest update to my **Playwright for Power Platform DevOps Extension**. This time, we‚Äôre not just running tests ‚Äî we‚Äôre dynamically assigning roles, business units, and teams to a test user before your Playwright test runs, and then removing them right after. Clean, controlled, reusable testing every time ‚úÖ

## üéØ What's new in this release?
- Assign security roles dynamically in a DevOps pipeline
- Switch business units and teams for your test user
- Clean up roles after the test completes
- Fully open-source DevOps task ready to install
- Compatible with any Playwright tests against Power Platform

This means fewer test users, more test coverage, and pipelines you can actually trust.

üì∫ **Watch the video now:** [https://youtu.be/lFHQ8HUsnMI](https://youtu.be/lFHQ8HUsnMI)  
üåê **Get the extension from Mightora.io:** [https://mightora.io](https://mightora.io)  
üí¨ **Let me know how you're testing Power Platform apps!**
