## Why It‚Äôs Handy

You often need to chase suppliers or clients via email. This approach helps thread those email updates directly into DevOps using **plus addressing** and **Power Automate**.

---

## What You‚Äôll Need

- A shared mailbox that supports plus addressing  
- Power Automate  
- Azure DevOps API

---

## Flow Overview

1. **Trigger** when a new email is received  
2. **Extract** the work item ID from the email address (e.g. `support+123@domain.com`)  
3. **Clean** the email content  
4. **Post** it as a comment to the corresponding DevOps work item

```powerautomate
// Placeholders for your expressions and HTTP request
```

---

## Wrap-Up

It‚Äôs a simple, powerful way to ensure nothing gets missed‚Äîespecially when your team lives in Outlook more than DevOps.
