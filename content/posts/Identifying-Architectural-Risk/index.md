## Techniques for Identifying Architectural Risk

In the realm of solution architecture, recognising potential risks is a crucial part of the design phase. Here are four strategies I have found to help identify architectural risks effectively.

### EMBRACE MNEMONICS: THE RAPP TECHNIQUE

1. **Review**: Begin with a thorough examination of the solution’s architectural diagrams. Trace the flow and connections across these diagrams, using your architecture use cases as a guide, to uncover any lurking risks. Lack of architectural diagrams should be flagged as a significant risk affecting both delivery and production.
2. **Assess**: Compare your design with the organisation’s established principles, standards, architecture patterns, reference architectures, non-functional requirements, and other technological frameworks. Extend this comparison to encompass industry standards and best practices, identifying any deviations or misalignments.
3. **Prompt**: Engage with your stakeholders during discussions or presentations of your solution architecture, encouraging them to identify any risks they perceive in the design. This may necessitate a brief introduction to the concept of risk, for which our “risk primer for solution architects” can serve as a valuable resource.
4. **Promote**: Reflect on each architectural decision made, alongside the risks these entail. Documenting, reviewing, and assessing the benefits, impacts, and associated risks should be integral to your decision-making process. Any decisions lacking this scrutiny should be considered a delivery and production risk. Highlight decisions with significant risks in your solution’s risk register.

By applying the RAPP method, identifying solution architecture risks becomes a structured and comprehensive process. Bonus points if you can inspire stakeholders to provide a beatbox backdrop during discussions!

## Solution Architecture Risk Prompts

Beyond the general RAPP technique, there are specific areas often prone to risks in solution architecture. Use the following prompts to uncover risks stemming from the architectural design decisions:

### DELIVERY RISKS

- **New Vendor**: Engaging with a new product vendor, implementation partner, or resource pool introduces delivery uncertainties. The level of risk correlates with the vendor’s role in delivery and the thoroughness of your due diligence.
- **New Technology**: Risks associated with unfamiliar technology include internal resource unfamiliarity and potential integration or configuration challenges within your existing environment.
- **Technology Dependencies**: Dependencies on external components or integration points can pose delivery risks, especially if those components are part of an ongoing development effort required for your solution.
- **Resource Dependencies**: The reliance on key individuals, due to their unique skills or expertise, can risk the timely delivery of your solution, particularly if these individuals are also in high demand for other projects.

### PRODUCTION RISKS

- **New Innovations**: Introducing new technologies or architectures necessitates new processes and learning, presenting risks but also potential for significant benefits and capabilities.
- **Legacy Technologies**: Older technologies carry risks related to outdated support, agility issues, integration challenges with new industry technologies, and difficulties in sourcing skilled support personnel.
- **Short-term Solutions**: Compromises made for immediate cost savings or expedience can complicate future enhancements or needs.
- **Security Concerns**: As a crucial aspect of risk management, security vulnerabilities must be diligently assessed and addressed.
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Refer to the exhaustive list of non-functional requirement categories on Wikipedia for additional risk identification prompts. These requirements are essential for ensuring the solution operates optimally within your environment.

### NEXT STEPS: DOCUMENT AND COMMUNICATE RISKS

Having identified potential architectural risks, the next step involves documenting and communicating these findings. We will delve into a streamlined approach for managing solution architecture risk registers in an upcoming article, providing a practical framework for risk documentation and communication.

This expanded approach not only outlines methods for identifying risks but also stresses the importance of comprehensive risk management in solution architecture, ensuring a robust, secure, and efficient architectural framework.
