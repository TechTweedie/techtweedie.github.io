## Why Use Entra External ID with Power Pages?

Power Pages is ideal for creating public- or partner-facing web portals, but managing access securely is always a challenge. Entra External ID lets you:

- Allow users to sign in with their own credentials (e.g., Microsoft, Google, etc.)
- Manage users in a scalable and secure way
- Reduce the need for custom authentication solutions

Combining the two ensures a secure, scalable solution for engaging with users outside your organisation.

## What You'll Learn in the Video

In the video, I take you through the following steps:

1. **Registering your Power Pages app with Entra External ID**
2. **Connecting your Power Pages authentication settings to Entra**
3. **Testing login flow as an external user**

By the end of the walkthrough, you’ll have a working Power Pages site that accepts sign-in via Entra ID for external identities—ready for use in customer or partner scenarios.

## Final Thoughts

Integrating Entra External ID with Power Pages is a vital step if you’re building a secure, user-friendly portal for external users. Whether you’re building customer-facing systems, partner portals, or community sites, this walkthrough gives you the building blocks you need.

As always, if you have questions or want to explore more advanced scenarios—like custom branding or consent policies—feel free to reach out.
