## What Would Happen If You Lost Your Dev Environment?

Ever wondered what would happen if someone accidentally deleted your development site or overwrote a key flow? Rebuilding from memory isn't just frustrating — it’s costly.

This post walks through the process I demonstrated during my session with the **Power Platform Learner to Leader** community, showing how to **automatically back up** your environment using **Azure DevOps**, without requiring advanced YAML knowledge.

## Why Back Up?

We’ve all seen it — shared dev environments, unmanaged solutions sitting idle, a delete button clicked in the wrong place, and *poof* — it’s gone. 

Setting up a DevOps pipeline gives you version control, rollback, and documentation *without* relying on memory or screenshots.

## What You’ll Need

- A Power Platform environment (Dataverse)
- Azure DevOps (free tier is enough!)
- App Registration with permissions to Dataverse
- Five free DevOps licenses included per tenant
- One-time parallelism request (12-hour approval)


## What the Pipeline Does

Here's what we built together, step-by-step:

1. ✅ Install Power Platform Build Tools
2. 🔐 Create a service connection with your app registration
3. 📦 Export your solution (managed & unmanaged)
4. 🔍 Unpack the solution into a Git repository
5. 📖 Optionally: Export reference data and download Power Pages site
6. 📄 Use my open-source DevOps extension to:
   - Document tables
   - Visualise relationships with Mermaid.js
   - Automatically commit changes to a Git repo
7. ⏰ Schedule it to run multiple times per day

> This gives you historical snapshots — no more guesswork on "what changed and when."

## What If You’re Using Dataverse for Teams?

I’ve built a special DevOps step that uses device login for backing up **Dataverse for Teams** environments too. It can’t run on a schedule (due to authentication), but it’s still a lifesaver when exporting and documenting your Teams-based solutions.


## Introducing: Mightora DevOps Extension

This free tool helps you:

- 📘 Auto-generate table documentation
- 🔗 Build relationship diagrams
- 🧠 Document Canvas Apps
- 🔄 Push backups to your Git repo
- 📅 Run backups on a schedule

It’s open-source and available via the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mightoraio.mightora-power-platform-devOps-extension).


## Try It Yourself

I’ve published the full presentation to GitHub with links and steps you can follow. Scan the QR code from the session or head over to my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/itweedie) to get started.

No more “what did I change last week?”  
No more “I wish I had a backup.”  
Start today — your future self will thank you.
