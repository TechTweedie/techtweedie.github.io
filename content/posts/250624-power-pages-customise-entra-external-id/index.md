# Walkthrough Customising Entra External ID for Power Pages

{{< youtube s99cqsJ-kDE >}}

## Introduction

Are you using **Entra External ID** with **Power Pages** and want to customise the login experience? This guide walks through exactly that â€” applying your own branding, images, colours, and layout to the Entra login screen for external users.

This is especially useful for creating a polished, consistent experience when your users are accessing Power Pages from outside your organisation.

> If youâ€™re new to setting up Entra External ID for Power Pages, Iâ€™ve also got a full video walkthrough on how to configure that â€” Iâ€™ll link it below.

## What You'll Learn

In this video and post, we explore:

- How to verify you're in the correct **Entra tenant** for external ID customisation
- Where to find **Company Branding** settings in Microsoft Entra
- How to add:
  - Favicon
  - Background image
  - Custom page colours
  - Header and footer logos
  - Links for privacy and terms
- Common pitfalls (like image size limits)
- How to test your branding changes in a live Power Pages scenario

## Why This Matters

The default login experience in Entra External ID works â€” but letâ€™s face it â€” itâ€™s pretty bland. For public-facing websites or citizen-facing portals, you want something that reinforces trust and shows attention to detail. Custom branding allows you to:

- Match your corporate style
- Reduce user confusion
- Deliver a consistent login experience from start to finish

## Tips to Remember

- Images like background and logo must be under 300KB.
- Youâ€™ll need the **Organizational Branding Administrator** role (or higher).
- Donâ€™t forget to test in the correct tenant â€” youâ€™ll usually have a separate **External** tenant in Entra for this.
- Email templates are not controlled here â€” weâ€™ll look at that in another post.

## Final Thoughts

This small step makes a huge difference in how professional your solution feels to users. Whether itâ€™s a public sector form, citizen portal, or partner landing page, getting your login screen branded properly is worth the effort.

Let me know if you have any questions or want a hand setting up your Entra branding!
