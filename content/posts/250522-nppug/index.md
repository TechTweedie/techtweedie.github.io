# Enabling Low-Code Developers to Create Custom Client Reports with a Helping Hand from Azure ‚Äì Norfolk Power Platform User Group

üìÖ **Date:** 22nd May 2025  
üìç **Location:** Norwich Digital Hub  
üçï **Pizza included!**

## Session Overview

At the Norfolk Power Platform User Group, I delivered a session titled:

‚ú® **‚ÄúEnabling low-code developers to create custom client reports with a helping hand from Azure‚Äù**

In this session, I explored:

- Using Power Automate to generate custom reports securely.  
- How to leverage an **Azure Function as a reverse proxy** to enhance security and scalability.  
- An architectural pattern that integrates **Dataverse, Power Automate, SharePoint, and Azure Functions** to deliver dynamic, client-ready PDFs via secure links.

## GitHub Repository

The demo and solution shared in this session are available on GitHub:

‚û°Ô∏è [AzureFunction-PowerAutomateProxy Repository](https://github.com/itweedie/AzureFunction-PowerAutomateProxy)

This repository includes:

- An **Azure Function HTTP Proxy** that authenticates requests and forwards them to your Power Automate Flow.
- Full support for **GET, POST, and OPTIONS methods**.
- Configurable environment variables to avoid hardcoded URLs or keys.
- Deploy-to-Azure templates for quick deployment into your own environment.

## Key Features of the Solution

‚úÖ Forwards all headers from the incoming request.  
‚úÖ Adds a custom `Flow-Key` header (from environment variables).  
‚úÖ Appends query parameters to the external URL dynamically.  
‚úÖ Provides a robust pattern for **securely exposing Power Automate flows as web endpoints**.

## Try It Out

If you‚Äôre interested in setting up this pattern for your own client reporting requirements, follow these steps:

1. Access the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/itweedie/AzureFunction-PowerAutomateProxy).  
2. Deploy using the **Deploy to Azure** button provided in the README.  
3. Import the **Power Platform solutions** to your environment.  
4. Configure your environment variables with your Logic App or Flow URL and secret key.  
5. Test your new secure reverse proxy-enabled flow!

## Why This Matters

Many organisations need to provide custom PDF or HTML reports to clients securely without exposing their backend systems. Combining **Power Automate for report generation** with **Azure Functions for authentication and reverse proxying** provides a scalable, secure, and low-code approach to achieve this.
