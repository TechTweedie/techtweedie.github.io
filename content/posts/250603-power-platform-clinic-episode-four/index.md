**Welcome to Episode 2 of the Power Platform Clinic with Duncan Boyne and Ian Tweedy.**

{{< youtube a8Ypoliuseo >}}

In this episode, Duncan and Ian dive deep into:

## üîê Power Pages Authentication Options

Ian breaks down:

- The difference between **public and private modes** in Power Pages.
- How **Entra ID, External Entra ID, and Azure B2C** work for authenticating users.
- Why using **Azure B2C or External Entra ID** is often preferred, including centralised identity management, SIEM logging, and reducing password management headaches.
- How these options relate to **OAuth and OIDC** protocols for enabling social logins like LinkedIn or Google.

Key takeaway: Understanding authentication options is crucial for designing secure Power Pages implementations that fit your organisation's user landscape, whether purely internal, external, or hybrid.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Setting Up Your Own Developer Account

Duncan and Ian guide you through:

- Using the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free developer tenant (noting tightened eligibility in recent years).
- Alternative approaches including:
  - Using **Visual Studio benefits** if you have them.
  - Starting with an **Office 365 trial** to activate Power Platform developer environments.
  - Keeping your tenant active by buying a minimal license (e.g. Exchange Online Plan 1) to ensure continuity.
- Creating your **Power Platform developer environment** for experimenting with solutions, apps, and portals.

They demonstrate step-by-step how to set up a trial tenant, activate the developer license, and spin up your first environment for Power Platform learning and testing.

## üí° Why This Matters

Whether you are:

- Building your first Power Pages portal.
- Testing authentication patterns for a client project.
- Exploring Power Platform features without risking production environments.

‚Ä¶ having your own developer environment and understanding authentication is essential for safe, efficient experimentation.
