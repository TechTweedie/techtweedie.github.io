    <description><![CDATA[Welcome to the very first episode of Power Platform Clinic with Duncan and Ian.
In this episode:
✅ Topic 1 – Show/Hide Tabs Dynamically in Model Driven Apps Ian walks through how to show or hide a whole tab in a model-driven app based on the value of a field, such as Status Reason. The demo covers:
Why you might want to hide/show tabs A full explanation of the JavaScript snippet used How to upload and register the script in your form libraries Gotchas to watch out for (like needing to register the event handler onload and onchange) Testing the functionality and reviewing console logs to understand what&rsquo;s happening under the hood 👉 This approach is especially useful when you only want tabs visible at specific record statuses instead of toggling individual fields.]]></description>

Power Apps recently introduced this helpful feature, and the best part is that it can be achieved using Power FX, the same language used for developing canvas apps.]]></description>
