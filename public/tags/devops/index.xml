    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="-playwright--power-platform--devops-pipelines-yes-please">üß™ Playwright + Power Platform + DevOps Pipelines? Yes please!</h1>
<p>Just dropped a new video where I walk through the latest update to my <strong>Playwright for Power Platform DevOps Extension</strong>. This time, we‚Äôre not just running tests ‚Äî we‚Äôre dynamically assigning roles, business units, and teams to a test user before your Playwright test runs, and then removing them right after. Clean, controlled, reusable testing every time ‚úÖ</p>

<h2 id="-whats-new-in-this-release">üéØ What&rsquo;s new in this release?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assign security roles dynamically in a DevOps pipeline</li>
<li>Switch business units and teams for your test user</li>
<li>Clean up roles after the test completes</li>
<li>Fully open-source DevOps task ready to install</li>
<li>Compatible with any Playwright tests against Power Platform</li>
</ul>
<p>This means fewer test users, more test coverage, and pipelines you can actually trust.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ever wondered what would happen if you lost your development environment? How do you feel about having to do all of that work again? What about if you spot a problem days later? Can you remember the value you changed three days ago in that flow? Have you ever seen someone delete the website record by mistake.</p>
<p>These are all situations I have been in over the last few years, and having a Pipeline in place to ensure backup of your hard work is extremely important. That historical record can save you many hours.</p>]]></description>
