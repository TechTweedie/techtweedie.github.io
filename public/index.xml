    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="-playwright--power-platform--devops-pipelines-yes-please">🧪 Playwright + Power Platform + DevOps Pipelines? Yes please!</h1>
<p>Just dropped a new video where I walk through the latest update to my <strong>Playwright for Power Platform DevOps Extension</strong>. This time, we’re not just running tests — we’re dynamically assigning roles, business units, and teams to a test user before your Playwright test runs, and then removing them right after. Clean, controlled, reusable testing every time ✅</p>

      ></iframe>
    </div>

<h2 id="-whats-new-in-this-release">🎯 What&rsquo;s new in this release?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assign security roles dynamically in a DevOps pipeline</li>
<li>Switch business units and teams for your test user</li>
<li>Clean up roles after the test completes</li>
<li>Fully open-source DevOps task ready to install</li>
<li>Compatible with any Playwright tests against Power Platform</li>
</ul>
<p>This means fewer test users, more test coverage, and pipelines you can actually trust.</p>]]></description>

<p>In this episode, Duncan and Ian dive deep into:</p>
<h2 id="-power-pages-authentication-options">🔐 Power Pages Authentication Options</h2>
<p>Ian breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between <strong>public and private modes</strong> in Power Pages.</li>
<li>How <strong>Entra ID, External Entra ID, and Azure B2C</strong> work for authenticating users.</li>
<li>Why using <strong>Azure B2C or External Entra ID</strong> is often preferred, including centralised identity management, SIEM logging, and reducing password management headaches.</li>
<li>How these options relate to <strong>OAuth and OIDC</strong> protocols for enabling social logins like LinkedIn or Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key takeaway: Understanding authentication options is crucial for designing secure Power Pages implementations that fit your organisation&rsquo;s user landscape, whether purely internal, external, or hybrid.</p>]]></description>

<li>How to split out the domain using the split function</li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to show or hide a tab in a <strong>Model-Driven App</strong> based on the <strong>Status Reason</strong> of a record? Maybe you’ve got a section of a form that’s only relevant when a record hits a specific state — like “Approved” or “Rejected”?</p>
<p>This post walks you through a reusable JavaScript snippet I’ve shared on GitHub that <strong>dynamically toggles tab visibility</strong> based on the <strong>statuscode</strong> field.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-is-useful">Why This Is Useful</h2>
<p>Sometimes users don’t need to see everything all the time. Maybe you’ve got a whole section for post-approval actions — or maybe you want to hide advanced options until a record is in a specific state.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Power Automate is a wonderful tool, but there is a world of difference between building something for personal productivity and utilising this amazing low-code tool for production, where an important business application will rely on it.</p>
<p>When considering a workload like this, we need to make it easier to manage and troubleshoot, ensure reliability, and prioritise security. Finally, if the worst were to happen, such as some credentials becoming leaked or an endpoint being compromised, how can we configure this so that damage is limited?</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently, I was asked if it was possible to place a message at the top of every form and view across an entire Model-Driven App. This message would then open a Custom Page that would display more detail. In this Blog post, I explain how this can be achieved and what steps need to be taken.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this demo, we will call a custom help page from a command button.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered if you can use Environment Variables in a PowerFX button, how to create a custom email link button in the command bar of your Power Apps model-driven application using environment variables and Power FX? Luckily, Power Apps has made it possible to achieve this. With the help of Power FX, which is the same language used in canvas app development, anyone can efficiently customise their app’s command bar without needing prior knowledge of JavaScript or the Ribbon Workbench.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Cloning multiple records within a data view in a Model-Driven App is a common request from end users. It helps them quickly fill out data fields in situations where only a few values differ between records.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore how to add a custom button to the command bar in a Power Apps model-driven application to duplicate multiple records. Power Apps recently introduced this helpful feature, and the best part is that it can be achieved using Power FX, the same language used for developing canvas apps. This latest capability has simplified the model-driven app development process, enabling anyone to customise the command bar, even those who are not proficient in JavaScript or experienced with the Ribbon Workbench.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="streamlining-webhook-testing-with-webhooksite">Streamlining Webhook Testing with Webhook.site</h1>
<p>I often find myself undertaking some form of prototyping or investigation. For instance lets say I am publishing an end point for a client to connect to via a HTTP call, often also referred to as a web hook.</p>
<p>One such issue this can introjuce is being able to see what is the actual request been made.</p>
<p>I came across Webhook.site, which has proved particularly useful in testing and troubleshooting webhooks. This platform has been a great help, especially in dealing with hidden values, such as setting the value but not the key value for API key authentication. By providing a straightforward way to inspect webhook payloads in real-time, without the need for a dedicated backend server for testing.</p>]]></description>
