<p>I often find myself undertaking some form of prototyping or investigation. For instance lets say I am publishing an end point for a client to connect to via a HTTP call, often also referred to as a web hook.</p>
<p>One such issue this can introjuce is being able to see what is the actual request been made.</p>
<p>I came across Webhook.site, which has proved particularly useful in testing and troubleshooting webhooks. This platform has been a great help, especially in dealing with hidden values, such as setting the value but not the key value for API key authentication. By providing a straightforward way to inspect webhook payloads in real-time, without the need for a dedicated backend server for testing.</p>]]></description>
