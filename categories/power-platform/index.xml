Maybe you’ve got a section of a form that’s only relevant when a record hits a specific state — like “Approved” or “Rejected”?
This post walks you through a reusable JavaScript snippet I’ve shared on GitHub that dynamically toggles tab visibility based on the statuscode field.
Why This Is Useful Sometimes users don’t need to see everything all the time.</description></item><item><title>Send Emails from Flow without a Service Account</title><link>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/240210-send-emails-from-flow-without-a-service-account/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 09:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/240210-send-emails-from-flow-without-a-service-account/</guid><description>Want to send emails from Power Automate but can&amp;rsquo;t or don&amp;rsquo;t want to use a service account?

When considering a workload like this, we need to make it easier to manage and troubleshoot, ensure reliability, and prioritise security. Finally, if the worst were to happen, such as some credentials becoming leaked or an endpoint being compromised, how can we configure this so that damage is limited?</description></item><item><title>Command Bar to Call Custom Page in Model Driven App</title><link>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/command-bar-to-call-custom-page/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 19:32:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/command-bar-to-call-custom-page/</guid><description>Introduction Recently, I was asked if it was possible to place a message at the top of every form and view across an entire Model-Driven App. This message would then open a Custom Page that would display more detail. In this Blog post, I explain how this can be achieved and what steps need to be taken.
For the purposes of this demo, we will call a custom help page from a command button.</description></item><item><title>Build a Basic PCF Field Control</title><link>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/build-a-basic-pcf-field-control/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 19:32:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://techtweedie.github.io/posts/build-a-basic-pcf-field-control/</guid><description>Introduction Want to get started using the Power Apps Component Framework (PCF), would you like to start building controls.
